RELEASE NOTES AND DISCLAIMERS

__The following additional terms apply to the C++ Library for RSS (the “Software”)
provided by Intel Corporation (“Intel”) to the recipient (“Recipient”).__

1. The Software implements the RSS calculations and rules corresponding to the following scenarios:
   - Multi-lane roads, i.e. longitudinal and lateral safe distance and proper response determination; and
   - Intersections, i.e. two or more routes of different geometry, rules for intersections of routes, with priority/right of way, and longitudinal and lateral proper response determination. However, in the case of intersections, it is assumed that there is always a lateral conflict.

   The following parts of RSS are __NOT__ implemented in this release of the Software:
   - Unstructured roads, e.g. parking lots and wide round-abouts;
   - Pedestrians, bicyclists and other vulnerable road users;
   - Occlusions;
   - Longitudinal or lateral evasive maneuvers as defined by RSS; and
   - Intersections without a lateral conflict.

2. Recipient understands, acknowledges and agrees that the Software:
   - is a pre-production, research version intended for use in a testing simulator;
   - should not be considered full, complete, or fully functional;
   - does not contain all features necessary for a production version of the Software;
   - has not been fully tested (including security testing) and may contain bugs, errors or faults;
   - is not suitable  for commercial or production release as part of a larger system in its current state;
   - may not be suitable for development of transportation testing applications for test tracks or public roads; and
   - has not obtained any regulatory approvals (such as, UL or FCC), or obtained any certifications or qualifications (such as, AEC-Q100) and may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments.

3. By using the Software, Recipient agrees to the following:
   - Recipient expressly assumes all risks associated with the use of the Software, which are provided “__AS IS__” by Intel with all faults.
