    long_description="ad-rss intends to provide a python binding of the C++ implementation of the Responsibility Sensitive Safety model (RSS) for Automated Vehicles. \
\
RSS is described in the following paper. Potential users of this C++ library are encouraged to read these papers in order to become familiar with the concepts and functions provided by the library. \
On a Formal Model of Safe and Scalable Self-driving Cars, S. Shalev-Shwartz, S. Shammah, A. Shashua, Mobileye, arXiv:1708.06374, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06374](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06374) \
\
The RSS module in this library receives (processed) sensor information as input and provides a proper response including actuator command restrictions as output. \
The input to the RSS module is an object list, with information about all objects (road agents) in the surrounding environment of the ego vehicle. \
For each object, the RSS module creates a description of the object-ego vehicle pair and their properties, called a constellation. \
For each constellation, the relevant RSS safety checks are performed and a proper response is calculated. \
Finally, one overall response is obtained by combining the responses calculated for each object-ego vehicle constellation. \
The proper response provided as output also contains the resulting actuation command restrictions, in the form of longitudinal and lateral limits on acceleration. \
\
ad-rss contains a stand-alone implementation of the RSS module. \
Conversion of AV sensor data to the input object list required by the RSS module is outside the scope of the ad-rss library. \
This includes conversion of object location and motion in a Cartesian world coordinate system into a constellation based coordinate system. \
Conversion of the output proper response and acceleration restrictions to real AV actuation commands (enforcing the restrictions) is outside the scope of this library. \
This conversion depends strongly on the software and hardware setup of the actual (or simulated) vehicle. \
