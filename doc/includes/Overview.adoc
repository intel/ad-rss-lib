# Overview

## Introduction
The Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model is designed to formalize
and contextualize human judgment regarding all multi-agent driving
situations and dilemmas. RSS formalizes terms like dangerous situations,
proper response and notion of blame in a mathematical way. From planning
and decision-making perspective, RSS ensures that the AD system will not
issue a command that would lead to an accident.

### Purpose and Scope
The design of the library at hand is based on the academic paper
_"On a Formal Model of Safe and Scalable Self-driving Cars"_.
The library will contain checks for longitudinal and lateral safe distance with
other vehicles. It will cover multi-lane roads and intersections.

The scope of the planned for end of Q3'2018 is:

 * Standalone C++-library containing the implementation as described below
 * Code quality will be ensured by automated testing with test coverage 80/50
   and static code analysis
 * Set of CarMaker scenarios to demonstrate functionality of library

[IMPORTANT]
====
The initial design does not yet cover:

* Respecting occlusions
* Checks with Vulnerable Road Users
* Checks for unstructured roads, e.g. parking spaces
