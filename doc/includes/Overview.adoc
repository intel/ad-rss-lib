## Introduction
The Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model is designed to formalize and
contextualize human judgment regarding all multi-agent driving situations and
dilemmas. RSS formalizes terms like dangerous situations, proper response and
notion of blame in a mathematical way. From planning and decision-making
perspective, RSS ensures that the AD system will not issue a command that would
lead to an accident.

### RSS Summary
The available RSS publications (see <<Table::Terminology>>), can be summarized
as follows:

1. RSS continuously monitors the _current_ state of the environment, in order
to determine if the ego vehicle is _currently_ in a safe state. If the ego
vehicle is not in a safe state, RSS will provide a response action that will
bring the car back into a safe state. As a result, in case of an accident, the
ego vehicle cannot be blamed responsible, as it was not causing the collision.

2. A state is regarded as _safe_, if the ego vehicle is not causing a collision
with another object, under the worst case assumption that the ego vehicle will
accelerate (depending on the situation this can be also a deceleration) at
maximum possible speed during its response time. Hence, RSS does not take the
output of the driving policy into account. However, as RSS uses worst case
assumption on reaction time, acceleration etc., it is guaranteed that, no valid
action of the driving policy can bring the vehicle into an unsafe state, if RSS
regards the current situation as safe.

3. If the ego vehicle is in a _dangerous_ situation, RSS will assure a proper
reaction, that will bring the car back into a safe state. Therefore, it will
impose proper restrictions for the longitudinal and lateral accelerations of
the driving command, that is send to the ego vehicle. Note that this will
assure that the vehicle reacts correctly, but the driving policy still has the
chance to solve the dangerous situation on a more elaborate way, as long as the
desired action is within the RSS limits. The reason is that RSS has only basic
information about the environment, whereas the driving policy can use much more
information, and is able to perform much more sophisticated path finding
strategies.

4. RSS differentiates between _longitudinal_ and _lateral_ conflicts. A
longitudinal conflict means that the distance between the ego vehicle and an
object in front or in the back of the ego vehicle is smaller than the
longitudinal safety distance. Similarly, a lateral conflict arises, if the
distance to the left or right of the ego vehicle to another object is less than
the required lateral safety margin. Depending on the type of conflict, RSS
requires a different response.

5. In addition, RSS differentiates between normal (single- or multi-lane)
roads, intersections and unstructured roads (e.g. parking areas). Depending on
the type of road, the required response for a conflict is different.

6. Objects are classified into _Vulnerable Road Users_ (e.g. pedestrians) and
other (dynamic) traffic objects. The reason for this separation is that the
first object group requires special safety considerations, as for example
pedestrians may have unknown routes, compared to vehicles.

7. RSS is not about:
- How to get "good enough" sensor data. It is about the usage, which may impose
  some sensor requirements.
- Avoiding collisions, if other traffic participants show a completely erratic
  driving behavior. Instead, it is about ensuring that the ego vehicle cannot
  be blamed for the accident.

### Purpose and Scope of this Library
The design of the library at hand is based on the academic paper
_"On a Formal Model of Safe and Scalable Self-driving Cars"_.
The library provides a C++ implementation of RSS according to the aforementioned
summary. The key component of this implementation is called _"RSS module"_.
This module receives (post-processed) sensor information and provides actuator
command restrictions as output.

In summary, the RSS module receives an object list, with information about all
object in the surrounding environment of the ego vehicle. Then, the RSS module
creates an object - ego vehicle pair, for each object. This pair is usually
referred to as _"Situation"_. For all situations, the aforementioned RSS checks
are performed and a proper response is calculated. Finally, one overall
response is obtained by the RSS module, and the corresponding actuator command
restrictions (i.e. lateral and longitudinal acceleration restrictions) are sent
out (see <<Figure:Library>>).

[NOTE]
====
The conversion from sensor data to the object list required by the RSS module,
as well as the conversion of the actuator command restrictions to real driving
commands, have to be implemented by the user of this library, as these parts
heavily depend on the actual vehicle setup.
====

[NOTE]
====
The scope of the planned release for end of Q3'2018 is:

 * Standalone C++-library containing the implementation of the RSS module
 * The RSS module covers multi-lane roads and intersections.
 * Code quality will be ensured by automated testing with test coverage 80/50
   and static code analysis
 * Set of CarMaker scenarios to demonstrate functionality of library
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The initial design does not yet cover:

* Respecting occlusions
* Checks with Vulnerable Road Users
* Checks for unstructured roads, e.g. parking spaces

### Overview of the Document
The remainder of this document is structured as follows:

- <<Section::HDL::Implementation>> provides an overview of the RSS
  implementation provided within the library. It discusses how each situation
  is handled, and discusses potential issues.
- <<Section::HDL::SystemArchitecture>> introduces the system
  architecture for RSS and the interfaces of the RSS module to other components.
- <<Section::HDL::SoftwareArchitecture>> provides a description of the
  software architecture, included the interface and data type definitions. If
  you would like to integrate the library into your system, this section, as
  well as <<Section::HDL::SystemArchitecture>> are of particular
  importance.
