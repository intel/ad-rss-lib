# Interface Component Description

## Overview
This part covers the description of all components of the RSS core library.
Briefly spoken, there are in total seven steps that are covered by different library
components.

1. Analyze a given scenery and extract all ego-vehicle - object pairs.
2. For each pair, extract all relevant object relations, i.e. on which lanes are
   the objects located, is it an intersection, etc.
   This information together with the object states describes a unique _Situation_.
3. Transform each situation from the global coordinate system to a local lane
   coordinate system.
4. Extract the allowed acceleration, deceleration parameters, based on the new
   coordinate system.
5. Perform the longitudinal and lateral _RSS checks_ for each situation.
6. Calculate the _proper response_ for each situation.
7. Transform the calculated response back to a global coordinate system

Consequently, there are three core components of the RSS library.

1. RSS environment
2. RSS checker
3. RSS response calculator
