The ad_rss_lib is implemented in C++. Based on a set of datatype definitions the interfaces are provided to:

1. prepare the RSS situations between individual pairs of ego vehicle and objects
2. trigger the situation specific RSS calculations
3. resolve the situation specific responses to one global response
4. translate the global response into concrete restrictions of the actuator control commands

Finally, the implementation of the ad_rss_lib is deployed within a set of artifacts.

====== RssCheck

Class providing the functionality of the RSS check sequence at once with the RSS world model as input and restrictions
of the acceleration for the actuator control as output. This class internally makes use of the RssSituationExtraction,
RssSituationChecking, RssResponseResolving and RssResponseTransformation functionality.

calculateAccelerationRestriction

Perform the calculation of the RSS checks on the current world model and provide the acceleration restriction for the
actuator control.

Returns true if the checks could be calculated, false if there was an error during the operation.

|====
|returns |bool |Out |False on failure.
|worldModel |WorldModel |In |The current world model information.

====== RssSituationExtraction

Class providing functions required for the extraction of the RSS situations from the RSS world model.

extractSituations

Returns true if the situations could be created, false if there was an error during the operation.

|====
|returns |bool |Out |False on failure.
|worldModel |WorldModel |In |The current world model information.
|situationVector |SituationVector |Out |The vector of situations to be analyzed with RSS.
|====

extractSituation

Extract the RSS situation pair <ego-vehicle, object> of the ego vehicle and the object to be checked.

Returns true if the situation could be created, false if there was an error during the operation.

====== RssResponseResolving

Class to resolve the responseStateVector of the different situation specific responses into a single responseState. This
class tracks the RSS response state of every situation id over time and especially stores the respective response state
before the danger threshold time. This requires that the id of a RSS situation remains constant over time in case it
refers to the same object; otherwise tracking over time will fail.

provideProperResponse

response states into one single overall RssResponse.

Class providing functions required to transform the proper response into restrictions of the acceleration for the
actuator control.

transformProperResponse

Transform the proper response into restrictions of the acceleration for the actuator control. Since the
RssResponseResolving entity is acting within the situation coordinate system, it is not able to decide on the actual
lateral movement of the ego-vehicle within its lane. Within this function the required world model data is available to
decide if a desired lateral response can be resolved either by applying a restriction on the lateral acceleration or, in
addition, requires a restriction of the longitudinal acceleration.

Returns true if the acceleration restrictions could be calculated, false otherwise.
