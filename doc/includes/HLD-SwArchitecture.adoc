The RssModule is implemented in C++. Based on a set of datatype definitions the interfaces are provided to:

1. prepare the RSS situations between individual pairs of ego vehicle and objects
2. trigger the situation specific RSS calculations
3. resolve the situation specific responses to one global response
4. translate the global response into concrete restrictions of the actuator control commands

Finally, the implementation of the RssModule is deployed within a set of artifacts.

====== RssCheck

Class providing the functionality of the RSS check sequence at once with the RSS world model as input and restrictions
of the acceleration for the actuator control as output. This class internally makes use of the RssSituationExtraction,
RssSituationChecking, RssResponseResolving and RssResponseTransformation functionality.

calculateAccelerationRestriction

Perform the calculation of the RSS checks on the current world model and provide the acceleration restriction for the
actuator control.

Returns true if the checks could be calculated, false if there was an error during the operation.

same object; otherwise tracking over time will fail.

RssResponseResolving entity is acting within the situation coordinate system, it is not able to decide on the actual
lateral movement of the ego-vehicle within its lane. Within this function the required world model data is available to
decide if a desired lateral response can be resolved either by applying a restriction on the lateral acceleration or, in
addition, requires a restriction of the longitudinal acceleration.

The RssSubsystem realizes the RSS part functionality. It implements the RSS checks based on the RssWorldModelData
received from the SensorSubsystem:

1. Keep a safe distance from the car in front
2. Leave time and space for others in lateral maneuvers
3. Exhibit caution in occluded areas
4. Right-of-Way is given, not taken

In case a dangerous situation is detected a respective proper response is calculated and the actuator control commands
received 
from the PlanningSubsystem are restricted accordingly to realize planning safety.
