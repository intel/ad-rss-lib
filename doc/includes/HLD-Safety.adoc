## Design for Safety
*TODO* Maybe we should explain here the differentiation between
Functional Safety (FuSa) in general and the planning safety which RSS is covering.

Basic idea would be: In principle, RSS is implementing
safety of the intended functionality.
One can apply RSS without FuSa to safeguard the planning functionality.
If one implements RSS in an ADS with FuSa constraints on system level,
RSS contributes to the FuSa goals of the whole ADS.
