## Key Design Decisions and Alternatives

### Lane-Based Coordinate System
The RSS definitions assume that the road is comprised by adjacent,
straight lanes of constant width.
To cope with general lane geometries a lane-based coordinate system is introduced
which allows to apply the RSS definitions to any lane geometry.

The transformation into the lane-based coordinate system is described by a bijective function.
Therein, the lateral position of a vehicle within the lane is mapped to a
parametric interval [0; 1].
