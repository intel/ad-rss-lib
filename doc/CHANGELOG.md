## Release 4.0.0

#### :rocket: New Features
* Support of unstructured scenes/pedestrians
  - Extended `ad::rss::situation::SituationType` by `Unstructured` value
  - Extended `ad::rss::situation::VehicleState` by `ad::rss::world::ObjectType` and `ad::rss::world::ObjectState` members
  - Extended `ad::rss::state::ProperResponse` by `ad::rss::state::UnstructuredSceneResponse` and `ad::rss::state::HeadingRangeVector` members
  - Renamed `ad::rss::world::AccelerationRestriction` -> `ad::rss::state::AccelerationRestriction` and integrated it
    as a member into the `ad::rss::state::ProperResponse`.
  - Reflected this merge of the data types by renaming `ad::rss::core::RssCheck::calculateAccelerationRestriction()`
    to `ad::rss::core::RssCheck::calculateProperResponse()` and adapting the function parameters accordingly.
    Same applies for `ad::rss::core::RssResponseResolving::provideProperResponse()`.
  - Extended `ad::rss::state::RssState` by `ad::rss::situation::SituationType` and `ad::rss::state::UnstructuredSceneRssState` members.
  - Extended `ad::rss::state::RssStateSnapshot` by `ad::rss::state::UnstructuredSceneStateInformation` member
  - Extended `ad::rss::world::ObjectType` by `Pedestrian` value
  - Extended `ad::rss::world::Object` by `::ad::rss::world::ObjectState` member
  - Extended `ad::rss::world::RssDynamics` by `ad::rss::world::UnstructuredSettings` member
  - Extended `ad::rss::map::RssSceneCreation::appendScenes()` parameters by `ad::physics::AngularVelocity` of ego and object
    and provide the mode of operation `ad::rss::map::RssMode` (NotRelevant, Structured, Unstructured)
  - Extended `ad::rss::map::RssSceneCreator` and `ad::rss::map::RssObjectConversion` classes to support unstructured scenes

#### :ghost: Maintenance
* Harmonized physics calcualions
  - Removed `ad::rss::situation::CoordinateSystemAxis` type
  - Refactored and extended calculations within Physics.hpp for unstructured cases
  - Made RssFormular.hpp public
* Fixed consideration of maximum speed on accelerating:
  - Renamed `ad::rss::world::RssDynamics::maxSpeed` member to `maxSpeedOnAcceleration` to clarify that it's not the general max speed
    of the vehicle, but the maximum speed to be considered while accelerating within the response time.
  - Fixed the calcualtions to consider the case that the current speed before the acceleration can already be higher than
    the `maxSpeedOnAcceleration` parameter and in this case just no acceleration takes place
* Improved BUILDING documentation

## Release 3.0.1
#### :ghost: Maintenance
* Fixed python binding for multiple python version built
* Added python interface test execution
* Updated documentation
* Fixed clang-8 and gcc-9 build

## Release 3.0.0

#### :rocket: New Features
* In preparation of the integration of unstructured scenes:
  - Deceleration values are given as negative values from now on
  - Remove separate Response Transformation to ease the merge of situations
  - On `LateralResponse::None`, the minimum value is not brakeMin anymore (that value was in each case irrelevant)
* Reworked scene creation
  - Made RssSceneCreation a class with supporting classes RssObjectConversion and RssSceneCreator
    to support multi-threaded scene appending.
  - Allow for scene specific ego vehicle RSS dynamics
  - Handle empty ego route correctly
  - Handle use-case: ego vehicle at back
  - Handle use-case: merging route
  - Restricting routes to relevant scene region to prevent from inaccourate relative distances
  - Ensure that NotRelevantScene also provides filled occupied region content
  - Workaround for route start within intersections: Use objectRoute intersection in intersection scenes if ego route
     predictions don't provide intersection data at all (to be solved finally within `ad::map::intersection::Intersection()` class)
  - Massively extended scene creation unit tests
  - Make use of `ad::map::route::getENUHeadingOfRoute()` for more accurate object heading on route calculation
* Renamed Math* -> Physics* and made header public

#### :ghost: Maintenance
* Adaptions for python binding built to support newer boost versions as well as multiple python versions at the same time

## Release 2.0.0
#### :rocket: New Features
* Added Integrating RSS with automated driving maps (ad_rss_map_integration)
* Added logging support with spdlog
* Introduced maxSpeed to RssDynamics and RSS calculations to support speed limits
  [for details see](https://intel.github.io/ad-rss-lib/ad_rss_map_integration/ConstructRSSScenes/index.html#considerspeedlimits)
* `world::Velocity` supports speed range input to be able to cope with speed fluctuations (i.e. in curves)

#### :ghost: Maintenance
* Refactored types and namespaces
  - renamed `ad_rss::physics::TimeIndex` -> `ad::world::TimeIndex`
  - renamed `ad_rss::physics::CoordinateSystemAxis` -> `ad::situation::CoordinateSystemAxis`
  - renamed `ad_rss::physics` -> `ad::physics` and replaced by separate library (ad_physics)
    to ensure map and rss are using the same base types
  - renamed `ad_rss` -> `ad::rss`
* Renamed actual shared library ad-rss-lib -> ad_rss
* Refactored folder layout
* Introduced colcon build [for details see](https://intel.github.io/ad-rss-lib/BUILDING/index.html)
* Fix unit tests for gcc 7.4.0 (shipped with ubuntu 18.04)
* Added ObjectIDVector support to Python binding

## Release 1.6.0
#### :rocket: New Features
* Added Python binding

## Release 1.5.0
#### :ghost: Maintenance
* License change to LGPL v2.1

## Release 1.4.0
* Introduced more straight forward interface on intermediate functions to support better integration of the single calls into an external
  framework: SituationSnapshot, RssStateSnapshot, ProperResponse. Moved the timeIndex from the individual elements into these high level
  types to support the propagation of the timeIndex even if there are no other vehicles in the surrounding.
* Did some renaming (e.g. ResponseState->RssState, ResponseStateVector->RssStateVector, ResponseInformation->RssStateInformation,
  ResponseEvaluator->RssStateEvaluator) to clarify by naming that the individual calcuated states only consider a snapshot in time without
  analysis of the dangerous threshold. The ProperResponse became its own type and got an own overall isSafe flag and a list of dangerousObjects.
* Added ObjectId to Situation and RssState to preserve the mapping to the originating object which was lost with the introduction of multiple
  situations per object.
* Increase amount of allowed situations because with multiple  situations per object the amount of 100 might be hit too fast.
* Improved merge of input scenarios to facilitate scene variations of the same situation
* RssIntersectionChecker: since new situations may pop up when e.g. a previously occluded object is entering the field of view, one cannot guarantee that a previous safe state can be found. In this case, we have to brake instead of returning false.
* Made some RssState operations available via public interface
* Add option to select library build type (static/dynamic)

## Release 1.3.0
* Allow multiple situations per ego vehicle/object pair: Add RssSituationIdProvider and made RssSituationExtraction a class holding RssSituationIdProvider instance to keep track of the different situation classes
* Renamed `world::Dynamics` in `world::RssDynamics`, extended it by responseTime and separated it from `world::Object`; `world::Scene` got the objectRssDynamics and `world::WorldModel` the egoVehicleRssDynamics each as separate elements
* Extended `world::Scene` by egoVehicle object description as occupied regions and velocity are actually scene dependent (e.g. when considering different vehicle predictions)
* Added `world::ObjectType::Invalid`
* Small updates to be compliant to clang-tidy-3.8 static code analysis
* Added basic FAQ
* Added official support for Ubuntu 14.04 (GCC 4.8, Clang 3.4 and 3.8/3.9)
* Added official support for Ubuntu 18.04 (GCC 7.3)
* Download/Build gtest on the fly rather than using the version from the OS
* Fixed documentation of RoadArea LaneSegment ordering (left -> right)
* Fixed isSafe flags of the resolved response
* Renamed some internal files from 'RSS...' -> 'Rss...' to have camel-case everywhere
* Added ResponseInformation to provide more insight into intermediate result calculation

## Release 1.2.0
* Added support for Clang 5 and Clang 6
* Added checks to enforce increasing time indices
* Consider timeIndex=0 as error
* Reduced maximum vector input sizes to more feasible numbers (20 lane segments, 50 road segments, 100 scenes)

## Release 1.1.0
* Made generated files and tests more explicit by moving into respective folders
* Extended documentation
* Increase test coverage
* Fixed calculateLateralDimensions()
* Extended extractSituation() by timeIndex parameter
* Support for GCC 4.8
* Harmonized library and git repo name by renaming ad_rss_lib -> ad-rss-lib

## Release 1.0.0
* Initial release
