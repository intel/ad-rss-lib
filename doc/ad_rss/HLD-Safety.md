## Design for Safety
In principle, RSS is implementing safety of the intended functionality
(SOTIF).
One can apply RSS without general functional safety (FuSa) aspects
to safeguard the planning functionality.
If RSS is implemented in an ADS with FuSa
constraints on system level, RSS contributes to the FuSa goals of the whole ADS.
